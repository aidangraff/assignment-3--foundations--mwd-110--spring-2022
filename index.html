    <p>One critic, Chris Jones of BBC, says, "Dumb, crude, three-chord thrash? Yes. Fast, exhilarating and brand new? Yes. Intelligent, boundary smashing and woefully underrated? Definitely. The Ramones were all of these things and more. Like a filmâ€™s opening credits their first album contains everything that their later career was to offer, and in 1976 nothing else sounded quite like it".</p>
